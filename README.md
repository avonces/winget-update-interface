# winget-update-interface
a simple and pretty batch file to add to your startup folder to automatically search for updates and install them [using winget (for lazy people like me)]

## Installation

1. Download the batch file.

2. Press windows + r and open the autostart folder by typing "shell:startup" and hitting enter.
